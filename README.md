# TypeDoc reproductions

If you find a bug in TypeDoc and file an issue, it's helpful -- even necessary -- to create a minimal reproduction of the bug.

This link explains why we ask for a minimal reproduction. Thank you in advance!

One way to do that is opening a pull-request on this repository with your reproduction. Github Actions will execute `./run.sh`.

You can put anything you want here: add/remove dependencies in `package.json`, change the commands in `run.sh`, change the code in `./src/index.ts`,
or add a hundred more `.ts` files.

Once your pull request is submitted here, link to it in your TypeDoc bug report.

# Bug report
Type aliases generated from `io-ts` package are expanded by TypeDoc into something unhelpful. 

The documentation for `myFunc` should be something like:
```
myFunc1(param: Test1): void
```

instead, it's:
```
myFunc1(param: {
    num: number;
    str: string;
}): void
```

Compare this with `myFunc2` which is documented as expected.
